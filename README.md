# Deep-learning
Various implementations of deep learning. Will include functions for setting up neural networks in TensorFlow. I intend to work with convolutional neural networks, regular neural networks, and recurrent neural networks.At the moment I am putting together the necessary calculus functions for backpropagation. My end goal will be setting up a neural network library similar to Karas and TensorFlow without using either Keras or TensorFlow
